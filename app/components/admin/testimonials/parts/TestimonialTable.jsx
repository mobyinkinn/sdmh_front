      "Worst service center My father visited hospital on 05.012 .2024 to take medicine traveling 600 km but medicine reacted on his body for which a whatsapp message was conveyed to Dr.BK malpani on no. 9829054938 on which they asked to stop the treatment and correlate to himself but in no vein. On 9.12.24 whatsapp call was made whether patient has to visit around 600 km to consult doctor or to discuss on message or whatsapp but no reply was received till 7.50pm dt 9.12.24. The patient was depressed and annoying to visit such a long journey that no hearing from doctor which consider that money is only issue by the doctor. Deeply depressed ðŸ˜”",
